# Emergent Horizon Algebras from Wheeler–DeWitt Constraints

This repository accompanies the research blog and arXiv preprint titled:
**“Emergent Horizon Algebras and the Isomorphism Class of Entanglement Wedge Operators in Non-AdS Spacetimes.”**

## Summary

We explore the time-evolving von Neumann algebra \( \mathcal{A}_R(t) \) associated with Hawking radiation’s entanglement wedge and its Type III₁ classification. The work further proposes that such operator structures can emerge from semiclassical Wheeler–DeWitt constraints near a dynamically shrinking horizon, even in non-AdS settings.
